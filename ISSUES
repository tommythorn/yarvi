Issues/todos:

  # Switch to 64-bit (rv64 tests, convert to RV64I isa,
    add the W instructions)

  # Add priv support (but no TLB yet)

  # Add M support

  # Add A support

  # Minimal FP load/store/convert + trap FP

  # Add caches & TLBs (trap on TLB misses and sw fill?)






  #0 Interrupt support (mostly done, but untested).

  #? Raise interrupts on RX full and TX empty.

  #2 Add caches

     - First a virtual 8 KiB directly mapped L1D$ and L1I$ (being
       directly mapped and no bigger than the page size guarantees no
       cache aliases, see. page 446 of H&P, ** 3rd ** edition.

  #4 Virtual Memory: ITLB/DTLB + sw filler support.

     Trap on TLB misses and define a set of CSRs to
     - access the missed address in a format to make page traversal efficient
     - read and write the TLB

     Initially a simple directly mapped TLB will suffice and avoid
     having to deal with (p)LRU.

  #? Trap illegal instruction and CSR accesses (unpriviledged too).

  #5 Traps: instruction {misalignment, address, illegal, priviledged},
     fp disabled, {load,store} {misalignment, fault}.
